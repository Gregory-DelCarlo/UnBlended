# Unblended
Unblended is a simple clone of the popular beer-based social network Untappd. I built UnBlended with a 
focus on whiskey rather than beer as it is a personal favorite of mine. This is my first full stack project 
using a multi-language stack, and represents the majority of what I learned during my tiem at App Academy.

## What's In the Stack?
This Project was completed using a Ruby on Rails backend and a ReactJS frontend. The backend works 
with a PSQL hosted database and interacts with it using active storage. In the frontend Node is used 
to package mainly Redux as a state manager used with ReactJS to handle the user interface.

# What's in UnBlended?

## A Fully Functioning User Authentication System
UnBlended features a full user authentication system that allows users to log in, logout, and create 
relevant data that is tied to their personal account.

## Robust Drink CreationSystem
While on UnBlended User's can view a multitude of whiskeys of all varieties. Users wishing to have their 
own whiskey's on the site can create drinks of their own, that is tied ot their personal account. 
Additionally when trying a whiskey user's will eventually be able to leave a review of that drink using a full rating system.
